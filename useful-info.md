## React

-   https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
    -   Take a look at the official react docs here
    -   Personally, I don't find these the best, but give a good overview
    -   They do have some nice tutorials like [this](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) one.
-   https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started
    -   Here are the official docs for Create React App
    -   They give a nice overview on `npx create-react-app my-app` and what it does
-   **https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started**
    -   Mozilla, like for all JS, has good documentation as well and a good getting started section
    -   I think this is a really good overview, and the React todo list tutorial is nice
-   **https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/getting-started-with-react-a-modern-project-based-guide-for-beginners-including-hooks-2/**
    -   This is a really good tutorial that walks through the whole process of bringing up a React app, and explains each part in pretty good detail

## Using VS Code for React Dev

-   Any text editor will work fine, but VSCode is my favorite for front end development
-   It is somewhat lightweight, and can be really powerful with tons of extensions, and has an insane amount of support and documentation on it
-   Here are some good articles on tips and good extensions to use with VSCode:

## Other Tools

-   **[GitKraken](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjc19HLtfT1AhXOkIkEHWViAc8QFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gitkraken.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw0AU8Mxbh7hWPN6_657fL7z):** my favorite Git GUI, included in [Github student developer pack](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjL-Li-tfT1AhUFkYkEHf-_AtkQFnoECAcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Feducation.github.com%2Fpack&usg=AOvVaw2Hd93-7RhFggjmT_mLZuU9) (which you should absolutely get if you have not)
-   **[Postman](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjC4LT1tfT1AhWxl4kEHVF_B-4QFnoECAwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.postman.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw05sjAjE_hbftSn2Ii8YG6N):** is an awesome API development tool, and lets you test out your endpoints
-   A good diff tool is nice (even though VSCode comes with a decent one), on Mac I use Kaleidiscope
-   An FTP client could be handy, on Mac I use Transmit or FileZilla
-   A tool to optimize and compress images for web is handy, I like Smaller or ImageOptim
-   A good Terminal
    -   On Mac the Terminal app already uses bash and works great
    -   On Windows GitBash is nice, Powershell can work, or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) can give you a full bash shell and linux development environment
    -   Also brush up on some common command line tasks:
        -   cd, ls, mv, cp
        -   scp
        -   starting processes using Systemd
        -   process manager like PM2
        -   Git on the command line
        -   ssh keys
    -   Just for fun, you could use zsh to customize your terminal, I like this one: https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/my-terminal-setu-iterm2-zsh-powerlevel10k-f7101ffc72c2
